# Persona, Fictional Character Database

Have you ever wanted to publish your original characters or your fursonas, with their stories, images and even RPG STATS ? This website might be for you! You can create your own characters there, share them very easely and chat with other OC creators on the website.

You can access the website in the "about me". But... for the moment I have some issues with the login and register.
I'll one day buy a domain name
